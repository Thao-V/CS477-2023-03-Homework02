1. Create a module including the following functions:
- sum(a, b): return the sum of two integers a and b. e.g. sum(1, 2) //returns 3
- divide(a, b): return the division of two integers a and b. e.g. divide(6,2) //returns 3
- multiply(a, b): return the division of two integers a and b. e.g. multiply(2, 3) //returns 6
After that, create a the application to test that module.

2. Create a simple Node script that converts 'www.miu.edu' domain name to the equivalent IP address. (Search and learn 'dns' module, resolve4)

3. Create a web server that's going to send a response of big image(bigger then 3MB) to any client that sends a request to your specified server:port. Use the best way for performance. (Try to solve this in many different ways and inspect the loading time in the browser and send many requests to see the performance differences)

4. Using Node Stream API, create a script to unzip a file (after you zip it). (Use zlib.createGunzip() stream)
5. (OPIONAL)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. 
Include this function to the module in the question 1.
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
